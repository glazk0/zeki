If you would like to contribute to the localization of Zeki, please refer to the [localization](.github/LOCALIZATION.md) guide.

## Self-Hosting

The inclusion of the bot's source code herein is primarily intended to foster transparency and facilitate other developers in incorporating similar functionalities into their respective projects.

Given the inherent simplicity of the bot, utilizing the publicly-hosted version is generally sufficient for the majority of users. It is strongly recommended to employ the public version, unless specific reasons necessitate an alternative approach, such as for experimental purposes.

While users are granted the autonomy to host the bot on their own servers, it is imperative to note that support for self-hosted instances will not be provided. Undertaking self-hosting is at the sole risk and responsibility of the user. Moreover, any attempts to monetize the hosted bot are expressly prohibited. The bot is designed to serve the community and self hosted instances are prohibited from monetization.

## Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/glazk0/zeki/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
